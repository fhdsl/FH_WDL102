# Introduction
This course is an introduction to designing and testing WDL workflows for beginner and intermediate users who primarily develop and run their own workflows for their own research work.  


## Tools to Edit WDL

VSCode (https://code.visualstudio.com/) has multiple extensions for WDL, including "WDL DevTools" and  "WDL Syntax Highlighter". 


## Customizing Workflow Runs

### Workflow Options

You can find additional [documention on the Workflow Options json file](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/wf_options/Overview/) that can be used to customize how Cromwell runs your workflow.  We'll highlight some specific features that are often useful for many users.  

### Runtime Defaults

```
{
    "default_runtime_attributes": {
        "docker": "ubuntu:latest",
        "continueOnReturnCode": [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
    }
}
```

### Call Caching



```
{
    "write_to_cache": true,
    "read_from_cache": true
}
```

### Workflow Failure Mode 


{
    "workflow_failure_mode": "ContinueWhilePossible"
}

Values are: `ContinueWhilePossible` or `NoNewCalls`


### Copying outputs

Read more details [here](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/wf_options/Overview/#output-copying), but the ability to copy the workflow outputs to another location can be very useful for data management.  

```
{
    "final_workflow_outputs_dir": "/my/path/workflow/archive",
    "use_relative_output_paths": false
}
```

If you want to collapse the directory structure, you can set `use_relative_output_paths` to `true` but if a file collision occurs Cromwell will stop and report the workflow as failed.
