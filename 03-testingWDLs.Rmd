# Testing and Scaling WDL Workflows

## Approaches for Testing
- start small - start with truncated/downsampled data in the same formats but smaller!
- add tasks one at a time and leverage call caching to test single additions quickly
- start testing scatters with a scatter of one!


## Scaling Up, Moving to the Cloud
- Test with a scatter of many small files (not full size!)
- Begin optimizing computing resources for each task
- Dockerize single task environments
- Test locally on small data scatters of 1 to shift from modules to Dockerize
- Catch errors and adjust such as tools that rely on filesystems/directory structures which will break in the cloud
- Learn about the cloud you'll be using
  - what instance types exist and which are the best for you tasks/data
  - how do the data need to be stored in an object store?
  - how can you get permissions set up to access both the data and the compute resources?
